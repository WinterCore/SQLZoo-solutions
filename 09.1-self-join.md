# Self join

Link: Link: https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Self_join

1. How many stops are in the database.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stops
```

2. Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'

```sql
SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart'
```


3. Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.

```sql
SELECT stops.id, stops.name from ROUTE
  JOIN stops ON stops.id = route.stop
  WHERE num = 4 AND company = 'LRT'
  ORDER BY pos
```

4. Routes and stops

```sql
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
  FROM route WHERE stop = 149 OR stop = 53
  GROUP BY company, num
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 2
```

5. Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. 

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON a.company=b.company AND a.num = b.num
  WHERE a.stop = 53 AND b.stop = 149
```

6. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown.

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON a.company=b.company AND a.num = b.num
  JOIN stops stopa ON a.stop=stopa.id
  JOIN stops stopb ON b.stop=stopb.id
  WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart'
```

7. Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith')

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num
  WHERE a.stop = 115 AND b.stop = 137
```

8. Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num
  JOIN stops stopa ON a.stop = stopa.id
  JOIN stops stopb ON b.stop = stopb.id
  WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'Tollcross'
```

9. Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'

```sql
SELECT stopsa.name, a.company, a.num FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num
  JOIN stops stopsb ON a.stop = stopsb.id
  JOIN stops stopsa ON b.stop = stopsa.id
  WHERE stopsb.name = 'Craiglockhart'
```

10. Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

```sql
SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart'
```
