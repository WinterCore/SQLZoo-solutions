# Using NULL

Link: Link: https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Using_Null

## 1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

```sql
SELECT name FROM teacher WHERE dept is null
```


## 2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
  INNER JOIN dept ON teacher.dept = dept.id
```


## 3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
  LEFT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept = dept.id
```


## 4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
  RIGHT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept = dept.id
```


## 5. Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given.

```sql
SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266') as  phone FROM teacher
```


## 6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name, 'None') FROM teacher
  LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept 
```


## 7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(mobile) FROM teacher
```


## 8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. 

```sql
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.id) FROM teacher
  RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept
  GROUP BY dept.name
```

## 9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name,
       CASE WHEN dept.id IN (1, 2)
            THEN 'Sci'
            ELSE 'Art'
       END
  FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept
```


## 10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name,
       CASE WHEN dept.id IN (1, 2)
            THEN 'Sci'
            WHEN dept.id IN (3)
            THEN 'Art'
            ELSE 'None'
       END
  FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept
```
